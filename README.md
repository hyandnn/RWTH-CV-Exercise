# RWTH-CV-Exercise

This repository contains a series of exercises completed as part of the **Computer Vision** course at RWTH Aachen University. Each exercise covers different aspects of computer vision, with practical implementations in Python using Jupyter notebooks.

## Repository Structure

- **exercise_1.ipynb**: Covers Gaussian filtering, Fourier transform, image derivatives, and edge detection.
- **exercise_2a.ipynb**: Focuses on MRF-based segmentation using graph cuts for efficient optimization.
- **exercise_2b.ipynb**: Implements sliding-window object detection with a car detector using HOG-like features and an SVM classifier.
- **exercise_3.ipynb**: Introduces PyTorch for training neural networks with TensorBoard used for monitoring.
- **exercise_4.ipynb**: Involves image classification using advanced models like ResNet and Vision Transformer.
- **exercise_5a.ipynb**: Focuses on local feature matching, Harris detector, and region descriptor matching.
- **exercise_5b.ipynb**: Explores 3D reconstruction techniques, including Fundamental Matrix estimation, RANSAC, and triangulation.
