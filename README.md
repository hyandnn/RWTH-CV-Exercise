# RWTH-CV-Exercise

This repository contains a series of exercises completed as part of the **Computer Vision** course at RWTH Aachen University. Each exercise covers different aspects of computer vision algorithms and techniques, with practical implementations in Python using Jupyter notebooks.

## Repository Structure

- **exercise_1.ipynb**: Introduction to image processing and manipulation, covering basic techniques such as filtering, edge detection, and histogram equalization.
- **exercise_2a.ipynb**: Feature detection using SIFT and SURF algorithms. Includes experiments with keypoint detection and descriptor extraction.
- **exercise_2b.ipynb**: Advanced feature matching techniques, focusing on FLANN-based matcher and RANSAC for homography estimation.
- **exercise_3.ipynb**: Object recognition and classification using traditional machine learning methods like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) on image datasets.
- **exercise_4.ipynb**: Implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification. Covers the design and training of a simple CNN on a dataset like CIFAR-10 or MNIST.
- **exercise_5a.ipynb**: **Semantic Segmentation using U-Net**. This exercise involves the implementation and training of the U-Net architecture for pixel-wise image segmentation. The dataset used is a medical image dataset, where U-Net is applied for tasks such as tumor or organ segmentation. 
- **exercise_5b.ipynb**: **Deep Learning Model Fine-Tuning and Performance Analysis**. In this exercise, the focus is on optimizing the U-Net model trained in `exercise_5a` through techniques such as:
    - Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size, optimizer choices)
    - Using pretrained models and transfer learning to improve performance
    - Performing cross-validation to evaluate model generalization
    - Advanced techniques such as data augmentation, dropout, and model ensembling to reduce overfitting and improve segmentation accuracy.
